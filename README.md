## Computing N Queens in Java

Based on the classic N-Queens problem, here we present a way to compute this and also avoiding the formation of straight lines with 3 or more Queens.


### Build

This require `gradle` installed.


> sh build.sh


Then we can use `nQueens.sh` passing the amount of queens to compute and an optional parameter (print) to display the boards


> sh nQueens.sh 4 print


This will set n <- 4 and print the boards found in the console.
